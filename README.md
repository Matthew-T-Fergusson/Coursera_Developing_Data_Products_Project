## Slidify did not work properly for publishing 

#### Please download and view the html from "index.html" to see the Slidify presentation.
#### Also published (but calculations not showing) using github GH Pages at: 
#####"http://matthew-t-fergusson.github.io/Developing_Data_Products_Project/"

#### Also see "index2.docx" if you have MS Word for a more easily viewed and formatted version

#### Additionally "index.Rmd" will show you what "index.html" should look like without the calculations.

### I apologize for the inconvenience. Thank you for being lenient with me.
